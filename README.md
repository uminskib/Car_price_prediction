# Car price prediction - data science project

## Introduction

The repository contains a data science project based on a database that comes from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset)
The database, called Car Features and MSRP, contains 11914 car models sold in the U.S. between 1990 and 2018.Each car is described by 16 variables.
The main goal of the study is to create a model that best predicts car prices based on the information collected. 
The structure of the project is as follows:
1. Introduction
2. Development environment preparation
3. Data structure and data cleaning
4. Exploratory and Data analysis
5. Feature selection
6. Modelling
7. Conclusion

Project created to test and solidify skills in using pandas, scikit-learn and seaborn tools. It constitutes a project for portfolio.
